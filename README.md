## WatchOsiris

Annoyed by the lack of email notifications of our Osiris student system and wanting to get some more experience with Python programming, I decided to create this tool to read your grades out of Osiris.

#### Disclaimer

As Osiris provides no official API for getting the data, this kinda hacks its way to it. It requires you to give your username and password to enter into the forms on the way, however it does work fully automatically.
It may break at every moment, because every small change in both the login screen (ADFS) and the Osiris platform will break this tool.

I am not taking responsibility for keeping this tool updated, but I may still do that.

This tool has no official link to the TU/e, nor does it claim it has any approval of any board at the TU/e. It's just a fun Friday project.
